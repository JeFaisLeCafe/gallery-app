# Project Overview

In this project, candidates for the app developer role are required to implement a simple screen using React Native. The goal is to create a media gallery app that fetches a list of image assets from an API, displays thumbnails of the images in a visually appealing manner, and allows users to view the images in full screen when tapped. The scope of the project is limited to working with image media assets only.

# Requirements

1. Fetching Media Assets: Implement functionality to retrieve a list of image assets from an API endpoint. The API should return a JSON response containing the necessary information for each image, such as the image URL, title, and any additional metadata.
2. Thumbnail Display: Display the fetched image assets as thumbnails on the screen. The thumbnails should be visually appealing and organized in a grid or scrollable list, allowing users to easily browse through the available images. 
3. Full-Screen Image View: Enable users to tap on a thumbnail to view the selected image in full screen. Implement a mechanism to smoothly transition from the thumbnail view to the full-screen view. The full-screen view should display the selected image with its original dimensions and provide options for zooming or panning if desired.
4. Error Handling: Implement proper error handling for scenarios such as failed API requests, network connectivity issues, or any other potential errors that may occur during the data fetching or rendering process. Display appropriate error messages or fallback content to inform the user about the encountered issues.
5. User Experience: Pay attention to the overall user experience and ensure the app is intuitive and easy to navigate.
6. Code Quality and Documentation: Write clean, modular, and maintainable code following best practices. Include comments and documentation to explain important parts of the implementation, making it easier for others to understand and maintain the codebase.

# Deliverables

1. A working React Native project that demonstrates the required functionality outlined in the project brief.
2. Well-structured and organized codebase that follows best practices and is easily maintainable.
3. Documentation or comments explaining key components and important implementation details.
4. Instructions on how to set up and run the project locally.

# Evaluation Criteria

1. Accuracy and completeness of the implemented functionality.
2. Code quality, including adherence to best practices and standards.
3. User interface design and overall user experience.
4. Error handling and edge case considerations.
5. Documentation and comments to aid understanding and maintenance of the code.
